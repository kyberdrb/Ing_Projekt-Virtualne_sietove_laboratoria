Vytvorenie Windows 10 virtualky s VirtIO ovladacmi

Introduction

This is a set of best practices to follow when installing a Windows Server 2012 guest
  on a Proxmox VE server 4.x. Right now it's a work in progress but hopefully soon it 
  will be a comprehensive and reliable document. Please feel free to add to it, even 
  if just to pose a potential best practice.

Install
Prepare

    Stiahneme si qemu kvm qemu-kvm virt-manager
      (aptitude/yum/dnf/...)
    Stiahneme si windows iso, ktory budeme instalovat
      (napr. cez Windows ISO Downloader)

    First, download the Windows VirtIO Drivers iso image
      https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Windows_Virtio_Drivers
      konkretne
      https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso
    ​After clicking "Create VM" enter a Name: for your vm, select your Resource Pool 
      (if you have one) and click Next
    Select Microsoft Windows 8/2012 in the OS tab and click Next.
    Select an ISO Image: for Windows Server 2012 in the CD/DVD tab and click Next.
    Select Bus/Device: VIRTIO, Storage: "your preferred storage" and Cache: writeback 
      in the Hard Disk tab (the No cache default is safer, but slower) and click Next.
    Select number of Sockets and cores (the default of 1 is mostly sufficient) in the 
      CPU tab and click Next.
    Select Automatically allocate memory and set the Maximum memory to a number you may 
      require in the memory tab and click Next.
    In the Network tab select Model: VirtIO (paravirtualized) and click Next.
    Click Finish.

    Go to the Hardware tab of your newly created VM
    -boot options -> check "ide cdrom 1"
    Select an ISO Image: for Windows Server 2012 in the CD/DVD tab and click Next.
    -In the "IDE Disk 1" select Disk Bus: VirtIO, Storage: "your preferred storage" 
      and Cache node: none (the 'writeback' is less safe, but faster) and click Next.
    -In "IDE CDROM 1" click Connect -> ISO Image Location -> Browse -> select 
      Windows installation ISO -> Choose Volume.
    -click Add Hardware -> Storage -> choose "Select or create custom image" 
      -> click Manage -> choose ISO image named "virtio-win-x.x.iso" 
      -> set Device type: CDROM device -> click Finish.
    -In the Network tab select Model: VirtIO (paravirtualized) and click Next.
    -Pridame USB mysku: Add hardware -> Input -> Generic USB mouse -> Finish

Launch Windows install

    Start your newly created virtual machine using the "Start" link in the upper right.
    wait until the vm icon has turned white before you login using the "Console" link 
      in the upper right.
    Start the server install with "Install Now" and select the Operating System Flavor 
      you like and click next and select "Custom: Install Windows only"
    If you do not see "Drive 0 / Unallocated Space" click Load driver, browse to CD 
      named CDROM and select folder WIN8\AMD64 (for win10 choose folder "w10")
      and confirm. Select all three offered 
      drivers (by pressing the CTRL button) "Red Hat VirtIO SCSI controller, 
      Redhat VirtIO NIC and Red Hat Balloon driver" and click next
      (see https://youtu.be/kSG6_A4MqFo?t=128 
      -> but after choosing vioscsi/w10/x86 no drives have been detected.
      only the viostor/w10/x86 worked)
    install Windows to "Drive 0 / Unallocated Space"
    Wait until Windows is installed and select a Password for the local Administrator 
    account and login to Windows.

Install addtional VirtIO drivers

If you don´t got all virtio drivers selected on install, you can install them also later.

    Start Explorer, Go to CDROM, copy folder WIN8\AMD64 to C:\Program Files\ and rename 
      AMD64 to C:\Program Files\VirtIO
    open Device Manager and right click on Other Devices -> Ethernet Controller and select 
      update driver software
    select "Browse my computer" select folder "C:\Program Files\VirtIO" and click "Install" 
      for Red Hat VirtIO Ethernet Adapter.
    again in Device Manager right click on Other Devices -> PCI Device and select update 
      driver software
    again "Browse my computer" select folder "C:\Program Files\VirtIO" and click "Install" 
      for VirtIO Balloon Driver.

For more information and configuration about ballooning, see Dynamic Memory Management
Further Information
RAW vs QCOW2

The RAW file format provides slightly better performance WHILE qcow2 offers advanced 
features such as copy on write and Live_Snapshots independent of the backing storage.

Shutdown Guest From Web UI

In order to be able to cleanly shutdown a windows server 2012 guest from console or 
  with backup schedule, some changes have to be done in the registry.

  launch "regedit.exe" and set value of 
    HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\winlogon and change 
    "ShutdownWithoutLogon" to 1
  go to 
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\
      7516b95f-f776-4464-8c53-06167f40cc99\8EC4B3A5-6868-48c2-BE75-4F3044BE88A7 
    and set "Attributes" value to 2
  then go to "Control Panel" --> "System and Security" --> "Power Options" and then 
    --> "Change plan settings" on choosed power plan --> "Change Advanced Power Settings" 
    --> "Display" and set 'Console lock display off timeout' to 0 to disable it


Win+r -> devmgmt.msc
  -Other devices
    -Ethernet -> right click -> update driver -> Browse my local computer -> Browse... 
      -> select virtio cdrom -> NetKVM -> w10 -> x64/x86 (by the OS architecture) 
      -> Next -> at the Windows Security prompt press Install
    -PCI Device -> same procedure as before, but instead of "NetKVM" directory 
      choose "Balloon"
    -PCI Simple Communications Controller -> choose "vioserial" (or go just iteratively
      one by one)

Continue with "Windows Optimization"

After the "Windows Optimization" we can shrink the image.

  sudo qemu-img convert -O qcow2 image.qcow2_backup image.qcow2

Now the image is reade to be imported to EVE-ng. Or not?
Windows 10 sa v EVE-ng nespustil. Ani ako virtioa.qcow2, ani ako hda.qcow2
Qemu malo odlisne parametre (vid nizsie) v porovnani s mojim PC.
Na mojom PC sa Windows virtualka spustila s plnou virtio podporou.
V GNS3 sa Windows virtualka spustila, ale iba s virtio sietovkou,
  pri virtio disku sa Windows spustil do modrej obrazovky s chybou
  "Disk not accessible".
Ale v EVE-ng sa Windows virtualka nespustila - zamrzla na bootovacej obrazovke.
